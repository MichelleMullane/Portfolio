              Frontend Developer, based in the eastern United States
            </h2>

              Welcome to my portfolio site! Originally from SE Pennsylvania, I
              have lived and worked all over the world. I earned my
              undergraduate degrees in Geology and Archaeology from Bryn Mawr
              College in PA before joining the Army as an Engineer Officer,
              gaining valuable experience as a technical program manager.
              Following my military career, I completed oceanographic research
              at the mouth of the Yellow River in northeastern China,
              implementing highly technical skills in advanced data collection
              and analytical techniques. I then worked in sustainability for a
              city government in San Jose, CA, supervising employees in program
              development and project management. Throughout my career, I have
              implemented technology and computer programming. Over the last
              year, I have hyper-focused on honing coding skills in advanced
              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building user-friendly applications and
              responsive websites.
